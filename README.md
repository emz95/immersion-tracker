# Personal Immersion Tracker 

This project is a personal immersion tracking tool built with FastAPI, Supabase, and Streamlit. It fulfills the core requirements of the Keploy API Fellowship by implementing a custom API with 4+ endpoints, full CRUD functionality, and integration with a real database. Users can log time spent on various language immersion activities, update or delete their logs, and view statistics like total time by activity type. A simple Streamlit-based frontend is also provided for interacting with the API.

## Features

- Log immersion activities (type, duration, description, date)
- Retrieve all logs
- Filter total time by type
- Update existing logs
- Delete logs
- Streamlit-based frontend for easy interaction

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
